## 🧬 Built With

- Python 3.x  
- **Scikit-learn** – For traditional ML models  
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – Deep learning models (Phase 2)  
- **SpaCy / NLTK** – NLP for resume/JD understanding  
- **Flask / FastAPI** – To serve models as APIs  
- **Pandas + NumPy** – Data wrangling

## 🧠 Main Modules (Planned)

| Folder/File         | Purpose                                   |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `resume_optimizer/` | NLP model to match resumes to job roles   |
| `career_classifier/`| Predict ideal career domains by interests |
| `skill_recommender/`| Suggest courses to fill skill gaps        |
| `model_api.py`      | Expose models as REST APIs via FastAPI    |
| `datasets/`         | Store CSVs, cleaned data                  |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📦 Install requirements:

```bash
cd ml
pip install -r requirements.txt
▶️ Run a script (example):
bash
Copy
Edit
python3 resume_optimizer/main.py
🧪 Sample Data Ideas
We'll be working with:

Resume datasets (.pdf, .txt, .csv)

Job descriptions from job boards

Career path trees

User-provided goals, strengths, and preferences

✅ Cleaned datasets go in datasets/
✅ Trained models saved in models/ folder (TBD)

🔗 Backend Integration
All ML models will be exposed through REST APIs via FastAPI or Flask.

Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
POST /api/ml/analyze-resume  
Body: { resumeText: "..." }

Returns: Matched job titles, scores, career suggestions
🧠 The backend will hit these APIs and forward the results to the frontend dashboard.

🤝 Contribution Notes
Modularize your code (train.py, predict.py, utils.py)

Comment everything – models must be explainable

Add usage examples to README.md in each subfolder

Use .ipynb notebooks for experiments / visualizations

Clean your data + save it in datasets/

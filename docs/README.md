## 🧠 Let’s Build with Clarity

This is not just a project — it's a **movement**.  
The clearer the architecture, the easier it is for others to join and contribute.

Welcome to the mind palace of DirektYou.

## 🧱 System Architecture

![architecture](./architecture.png)

This diagram represents how DirektYou's core systems interact:  
- Frontend (React/Next.js) connects to Backend (Node.js/Express)  
- Backend interfaces with MongoDB and ML Microservices  
- FastAPI/Flask handles ML model APIs  
- JWT Auth, CI/CD, and Discord ecosystem are also shown
